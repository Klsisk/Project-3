# Project-3

We as a group are looking at four NBA data sets that have data ranging from players, teams, salaries, and statistics. We are hoping to use this data to formulate different trends among the NBA. We are focusing on the 2017-2018 season. We are looking to determine repeated factors among successful NBA players and their teams.  These factors could include such things as salary, points per game, bang for buck, and all-star appearance.

We will begin the project by extracting the four different data sets mentioned above using Python. Using Pandas to transform the data, we should be able to start up a relational database (postgreSQL) to store the tables.  From there, we will use Flask to create an API web application and then will use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create our visualizations. We plan to make use of d3 to aid in making an ineteractive chart.

A final product will be various charts that will help us formulate what repeated factors successful NBA players have and if they may correlate at all with the amount they are paid (ex. minutes played, total points, what team they play for, etc).
