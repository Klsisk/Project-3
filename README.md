# Project-3

We as a group are looking at three NBA datasets that have data ranging from players, teams, salaries, and statistics. We are hoping to use this data to formulate different trends among the NBA. We are focusing on the 2017-2018 season. We are looking to tell the story of what attributes increase your chances of making the all star team in the NBA?

We will begin the project by extracting the three different datasets mentioned above. We will then transform the data to match by matching the players in all three sets. Using Pandas to achieve this, we should be able to start up a relational database (pg Admin 4 or MongoDB) to store the tables.  From there, we will use Flask to create an API and then use JavaScript to create our visulaizations. 

A final product will be various charts that will help us formulate what characteristics help to get players placed on the All-Str team (ex. minutes played, total points, what team they play for,etc).
